### How To Run:

First you need to make sure you have anaconda installed. If not, you can download it here: https://www.anaconda.com/

Once you have this downloaded, you will need to install the required packages. In order to do this, you will need to open up the anaconda command prompt and install PyTorch and TorchVision.
Once you have the command prompt opened up, type: "conda install torch" (Do not include quotes). From here, you will now want to install torchvision, type: "conda install -c pytorch torchvision" (Do not include quotes).
